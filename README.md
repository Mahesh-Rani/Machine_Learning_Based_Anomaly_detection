GitHub Documentation for the Python Notebook
Since you are uploading your Python Notebook file to GitHub, you must provide clear and detailed documentation in your GitHub repository. This will ensure that reviewers, users, or collaborators can understand, replicate, and evaluate your work effectively. Here's what you should include:

1. Repository Overview
In your repository's README.md file, provide a brief introduction to your project:

Project Title: Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection.
Description: Describe the project's goal, such as "This repository implements an anomaly detection system using Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM models, leveraging the UNSW-NB15 dataset."
Key Features:
Preprocessing network traffic data.
Training anomaly detection models.
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Robustness testing with adversarial samples.
2. File Structure
Include a description of all files and folders in the repository. For example:

Machine_Learning_Based_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all implementation steps.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries for running the notebook.
Datasets: Instructions for downloading and using the UNSW-NB15 dataset (since it may not be included in the repository for size reasons).
3. Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file to list all dependencies used in your Python Notebook. These may include:

plaintext
Copy code
scikit-learn==1.1.2
numpy==1.23.4
pandas==1.5.3
matplotlib==3.6.2
seaborn==0.12.1
tensorflow==2.11.0  # (if FGSM is implemented using TensorFlow)
This allows users to install the necessary libraries with the command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Instructions for Running the Notebook
In the README.md file, provide detailed steps for running the notebook:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
cd YourRepository
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Machine_Learning_Based_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb
Follow the notebook cells sequentially:
Upload the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
Run the preprocessing steps.
Train the models.
Evaluate results and test adversarial robustness.
5. Dataset Instructions
Explain where and how to download the UNSW-NB15 dataset, including preprocessing steps:

Provide the download link (e.g., from Kaggle or official sources).
Explain how to upload the dataset into the notebook or the directory structure required.
6. Outputs and Results
Mention the expected outputs of the notebook:

Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Visualizations (confusion matrices, feature importance plots, etc.).
Adversarial testing results (e.g., model accuracy after FGSM testing).
